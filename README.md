## 🖥️ Summary
**React 기반의 할 일 목록 앱을 활용한 웹사이트**입니다. 포트폴리오용으로 제작되었으며, 할 일 목록의 입력 및 추가, 중요도 표시, 삭제, 완료 여부 등의 기능을 직접 구현하였습니다.
조금씩 공부하고 있던 React.js를 활용하여 컴포넌트 사용에 대해 구체화 할 수 있었습니다.


## 🕰️ 개발 기간
* 24.03.24 - 24.03.26


##  📌 주요 기능

✅ 연도와 날짜 표시

✅ 할 일 작성과 추가

✅ 완료 여부 체크하기

✅ 중요도 별 표시로 확인하기

✅ 목록 삭제 하기


## 🤔 Background
React 학습을 위해 진행한 토이 프로젝트로, 실제로 투두리스트(Todo List)라고 불리는 유형의 할 일 목록 앱을 참고하여 개발한 웹사이트입니다.  대부분의 할 일 목록 앱들에 기초가 되는 기능과 UI를 편리하게 사용할 수 있도록 간결하고 직관적으로 직접 개발하였습니다.


## 🔨 Technology Stack(s)
* Design : Figma, Photoshop
* Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, javascript
* Deployment: gitHub

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
